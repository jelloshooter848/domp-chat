# Nostr Chat Implementation Progress

## Project Overview
Converting the Friend Chat App from Firebase to a Nostr-only decentralized messaging system.

## Completed âœ…

### Phase 1: Basic Nostr Integration
- [x] Added nostr-tools library (v2.7.2)
- [x] Created NostrClient class for relay management
- [x] Implemented key pair generation and storage
- [x] Added relay connection testing with timeout (8s total, 3s per relay)
- [x] Created visual connection status indicators
- [x] Added detailed console logging for debugging

### Phase 2: Core Messaging
- [x] Implemented Nostr message sending for public rooms
- [x] Added room-based message subscriptions using Nostr tags
- [x] Created fallback to local mode when Nostr fails
- [x] Removed all Firebase dependencies
- [x] Simplified codebase to Nostr + local only

### Phase 3: UI/UX Updates
- [x] Added backend status indicator in chat header (ðŸŸ¢ Nostr / ðŸ”´ Local)
- [x] Created loading spinner during connection
- [x] Added connection success/failure notifications
- [x] Updated welcome messages to show active backend

## Currently Working On ðŸ”„

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Verify Nostr connection works consistently
- [ ] Test message sending/receiving between users
- [ ] Validate relay connectivity across different networks
- [ ] Check local mode fallback functionality

## To Do ðŸ“‹

### Phase 4: Private Messaging
- [ ] Implement pubkey exchange mechanism for private chats
- [ ] Add encrypted direct messages (NIP-04/NIP-44)
- [ ] Create private chat request system via Nostr events
- [ ] Update UI for private message notifications

### Phase 5: User Presence & Management
- [ ] Implement user presence via Nostr events
- [ ] Add online/offline status tracking
- [ ] Create user discovery mechanism
- [ ] Replace username system with Nostr identity

### Phase 6: Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement message history loading from relays
- [ ] Add message persistence across sessions
- [ ] Create room management via Nostr events
- [ ] Add support for custom relay lists

### Phase 7: Admin & Moderation
- [ ] Adapt admin panel for decentralized environment
- [ ] Implement mute lists and content filtering
- [ ] Add relay-based moderation tools
- [ ] Create admin authentication via Nostr keys

### Phase 8: Polish & Optimization
- [ ] Add error handling and reconnection logic
- [ ] Implement message deduplication
- [ ] Add offline message queuing
- [ ] Optimize subscription management
- [ ] Add configuration options for power users

## Technical Architecture

### Current Relay List
- `wss://relay.damus.io`
- `wss://nostr-pub.wellorder.net`
- `wss://relay.nostr.info`
- `wss://nos.lol`

### Event Types Used
- **Kind 1**: Public messages with room tags (`#t friendchat_{roomname}`)
- **Kind 4**: Encrypted direct messages (planned)
- **Kind 1**: User presence events (planned)

### Storage Strategy
- **Nostr Keys**: localStorage (`nostr_private_key`)
- **Local Messages**: localStorage fallback
- **User Settings**: localStorage

## Known Issues & Challenges

### Current Issues
- [ ] Private messaging requires pubkey exchange implementation
- [ ] User presence system needs design
- [ ] Message history limited to subscription window
- [ ] No cross-device synchronization yet

### Design Decisions Needed
- [ ] How to handle username â†’ pubkey mapping
- [ ] Room creation/management in decentralized system
- [ ] Admin privileges in decentralized context
- [ ] Message retention and history strategy

## Testing Checklist

### Connection Testing
- [ ] Test with all relays working
- [ ] Test with some relays failing
- [ ] Test with no internet connection
- [ ] Test relay reconnection after network issues

### Messaging Testing
- [ ] Send/receive public messages
- [ ] Switch between rooms
- [ ] Test with multiple users simultaneously
- [ ] Verify message ordering and deduplication

### Fallback Testing
- [ ] Verify local mode works without Nostr
- [ ] Test localStorage persistence
- [ ] Confirm graceful degradation

## Next Session Goals
1. Verify current Nostr connection is working
2. Test message sending/receiving between browser tabs
3. Fix any connection issues discovered
4. Begin private messaging implementation
